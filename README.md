# Sortring-Algorithms-Visualiser


A visualisation of the most common sortring algorythms.
For a demo of the project plese check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5rXedx7pZ8&feature=youtu.be

Done using c++ and Qt 5.14.2


The project is pretty self explanatory, the top slide bars can change the array size and the speed of the animation.
Each "sort" button change between the sorting algorithms.

# Logic

To achive the "step-by-step" sortring we store all the swaps that would have been made by the sortring algorythm.
in the interface we change the bars acording to the swaps recorder, updating the scene each time.
